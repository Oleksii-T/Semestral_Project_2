Overview of functions.
=====================

1. 'err'-------Accept one string argument. Used to handle errors in script.
               It prints error message and terminates the program.
2. 'debug'-----Accept one int argument. Used to trace the stage of the program.
               Can be turnded on/off with variable 'DEBUG'(option '-d').
3. 'help'------Used to print main information about script usage 
               Gives overview of syntax and valid options.
4. 'cleanup'---Used as a save function to delete generated file.
5. 'CheckEffectParams'---Checks the validity of variables, Else use 'err' func
6. 'FillEffectParams'----Spread one var 'ep' which contain all Effect Parameters
                         to individual variables. After spreading call 
                         func 'CheckEffectParams'. And then, formulate each
                         variable to understandable form for Gnuplot.
7. 'ReadConfFile'--------Used to read whether Default configuration file (which
                         always read in the very beginning of the script) or
                         specified by user file. Creates temporary directory 
                         and copy there simplified configuration file.
                         Fills appropriate variables to further usage.
                         Calls 'FillEffectParams' and delete tmp directory
8. 'CheckOptions'--------Checks the validity of variables, after option processing.
9. 'CheckTimeStampDigit'-Make sure that years, months, days, hours, minutes
                         and seconds are valid.
10. 'CheckData'----------Firstly make regular expresion from timestamp, then
                         compare it with each timestamp is file.
                         If everything is fine, make sort of merged tmp file.

Main steps in body.
===================

1. Default Configuration file is read by calling 'ReadConfFile'.
2. Option processing.
3. Iterating through DATA(input files) and merging them into one text file,
   which is located in temporary directory.
4. Checking for validity of input file and variables, filling few usefull
   variables used in further computation. Check correctness of data file.
   Make sorting.
5. Substitution of all spaces within timestamp with '_' in order to facilitate
   work of gnuplot
6. Computing Y and X axis range.
7. Loop of image creation. With each iteration, one frame is generated.
8. One last command: joining frames into animation.

Debug.
======

One additional parameter is 'debug' is allowed. You could specify it by -d [value].
To enable full monitoring of the program just enter any not 0 int as a value.
[0] value is used to turn off the debuging(used by default).
