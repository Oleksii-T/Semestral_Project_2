*******************

The script is assigned to create a graph from text files.
The graph itself is constructed using the Gnuplot Plotting Utility.
The output of the program is formed into directories which contain:
 1.Frames "[number].png"
 2.Animation file "Animation.mp4"
'gnuplot' version 4.0 or higher is required.
'avconv' utility is required(to merge frames into animation).
For proper work input files must be in script directory.

How to use.
===========

1. Go to directory where script is located.
2. Type: "./Myscript [parameters] [inputfiles]".

Required text file form.
========================

All input files must contain two columns of data.
First - the timestamp, second - numeric value.
Each row must consist of both timestamp and value.
Timestamp is a free formed string including next Format Specifiers:
+------+-------------------------------------------------------+
|Format| Explanation                                           |
+------+-------------------------------------------------------+
|  %d  | day of the month, 1-31                                |
|  %m  | month of the year, 1-12                               |
|  %y  | year, 0-99                                            |
|  %Y  | year, 4-digit                                         |
|  %j  | day of the year, 1-365                                |
|  %H  | hour, 0-24                                            |
|  %M  | minute, 0-60                                          |
|  %s  | seconds since the Unix epoch (1970-01-01 00:00 UTC)   |
|  %S  | second, 0-60                                          |
|  %b  | three-character abbreviation of the name of the month |
|  %B  | name of the month                                     |
+------+-------------------------------------------------------+
The timestamp format must be described additionally as a parameter.

Valid parameters.
=================

-h              help.
-t format       Time Format used to describe x-axis.
-Y/-y value     Y and y responsible for maximum and minimum values of Y-axis
                respectively. Value could be:
                'max'  program compute maximum value of Y-axis and use it every time.
                'auto' graph will be zoomed out due to the max value of Y-axis.
                'fixed'  you can enter some constant to make dimensions strictly defined.
-S value        Amount of lines per one slide of animation.
-T value        Animation duration in seconds.
-F value        Frames per second.
-l value        Graph title.
-g parameter    Gnuplot parameters. Can be called few times.
-e option       Effect parameters. See valid list below. Can be called few times.
                Option is a couple 'parameter=value' which can be user more than once,
                separated by ':'. configuration file can be specified,
                thus program will read values from it.
-n name         Project name, used for names of directories generated by program.
								If more then 1 file was specified idex will be added to.
								the name e.g: name_1 and so on.
								
Valid Effect parameters.
========================

1. boxcolor=[value]       Color of the bars ploted.
2. ylabel="name"          Name of Y-axis.
3. xlabel="name"          Name of X-axis.
4. boxwidth=[value]       Width of each bar [0-1].
5. borderscolor=[value]   Color of borders between each bar.
6. fillpattern=[value]    Bars filling pattern [0-7].
7. boxtitle=[name]      	Title of boxes which will be written oi the graph.
8. arrowstyle=[value]     Options for arrows e.g. head_empty_size_screen_0.03,15,135_ls_2
                          Instead of spaces it is required to use '_'.
